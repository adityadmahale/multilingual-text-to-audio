![Architecture](Architecture.png?raw=true "Architecture") 

During COVID times, the world shifted to online mediums to educate its audience. Whether it's YouTube or other video streaming services, every platform witnessed a surge in subscribers/users for their educational content. However, communication is limited to a few users due to language constraints. 
 
Accessible education is indispensable in today's world. It is imperative to make the audio available in different languages to reach out to wider audience. The purpose of this project is to build a web application that translates English language text to a different language (Speech). 
 
There are plenty of video streaming services online providing transcripts in different languages. However, the audio is not available in other languages.
